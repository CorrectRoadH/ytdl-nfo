# ytdl-nfo : youtube-dl NFO generator

[youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) is an incredibly useful resource to download and archive footage from across the web. Viewing and organising these files however can be a bit of a hassle.

**ytdl-nfo** takes the `--write-info-json` output from youtube-dl and parses it into Kodi-compatible .nfo files. The aim is to prepare and move files so as to be easily imported into media centers such as Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, etc.
